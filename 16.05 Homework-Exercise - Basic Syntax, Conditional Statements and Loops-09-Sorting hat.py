# Help out the sorting hat to sort the new students in the houses of Hogwarts.
# You will be receiving names until the command "Welcome!". The length of each name
# determines in which house the student is going:
# •	If the name is less than 5 chars, the student is going into Gryffindor
# o	Print "{name} goes to Gryffindor."
# •	If the name is exactly 5 chars, the student is going into Slytherin
# o	Print "{name} goes to Slytherin."
# •	If the name is exactly 6 chars, the student is going into Ravenclaw
# o	Print "{name} goes to Ravenclaw."
# •	If the name is more than 6 chars, the student is going into Hufflepuff
# o	Print "{name} goes to Hufflepuff."
# While receiving names, if you receive "Voldemort", print "You must not speak of that name!"
# and end the program. No more sorting for today!
# If all students are sorted successfully, print "Welcome to Hogwarts."
