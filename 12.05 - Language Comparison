1. Execution Model. Compiler VS interpreter
    a) Language execution model
        - Compiled languages
            * source code is first compiled to machine code, then executed
            * syntax errors are found during the compilation (at compile time)
            * C#, Java, C, C++, Swift, Go, Rust
        - Interpreted languages
            * each command is read, parsed and executed by an interpreter
            * syntax errors are found at run-time, during execuiton
            * Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby
    b) statically-typed VS dynamic-typed
        - statically-typed languages perform type checking at compile time
            * C#, Java, C++, Swift
        - dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime
            * Python, JavaScript, PHP

2. Variables. Declaring variables in C#, JavaScript and Python.
    a) declaring variables in C#
        - to declare a variable in C# you need to use the pattern : {data type} {variable name} = {value};
            * int number = 5;
            * string name = "Peter";
            * bool isPassed = false;
            * char gender = "f";
            * double grade = 5.49;
    b) declaring variables in JavaScript
        - to declare a variable in JavaScript you need to use the keyword : let {variable name} = {value};
            * let number = 5;
            * let name = "Peter";
            * let isPassed = true;
            * let grade = 5.49;
    c) declaring variables in Python
        - Python has no keyword for declaring a variable
        - variables do no need to be declared with any particular type
            * first_number = 5
            * name = "Peter"
            * is_passed = False
            * grade = 5.49

3. Data types.
    a) data types in C#
        * integer - int, long
        * real number - double, float
        * text - string, char
        * boolean - bool
        * other - object
    b) data types in JavaScript
        - in JavaScript data types are inferred from the values
            * number
            * string
            * boolean
            * object
            * null
            * undefined
    c) data types in Python
        - in Python variables keep values of certain type. The data is inferred from the value.
            * int
            * float
            * str
            * boolean
            * list

4. Printing on the console.
    a) printing on the console in C#
        - printing and then going to a new line:
            * Console.WriteLine("...");
        - printing content and staying on the same line:
            * Console.Write("...");
        - printing and formatting
            * Console.WriteLine($"{name} is {age}-years old.");
    b) printing on the console in JavaScript
        - printing and then going to a new line:
            * console.log("...");
        - printing content and staying on the same line:
            * process.stdout.write("...");
        - printing and formatting
            * console.log($"{name}");
    c) printing on the console in Python
        - printing and then going to a new line:
            * print("...")
        - printing content and staying on the same line:
            * print("...", end=")
        - printing and formatting
            * print(f"{name}")
